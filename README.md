## Developement 

1. Project setup
    - Install dependent modules
        ```bash
        $ npm install
        ```
2. Compiles and hot-reloads for **development**
    - Type the command below for development.
        ```bash
        # It will reload every time you save it.
        $ npm run serve 
        ```
## Deployment
- This github project is synchronized to Heroku. Everytime we push to master, Heroku will automatically deploy this project to a webiste.
- If you want to deploy your own version, you will have to fork this project and build it up on Heroku yourself. 

## Environment
1. Vue: ``2.6.11`` (Frontend framework)
2. Bootstrap: ``5.1.3`` (Frontend toolkit)
3. Firebase: ``9.8.1`` (Backend)
4. Heroku: (Deployment)

## Note 
If you want to update Vue2 to Vue3, you will have to tackle incompatible modules (27 modules in total). GOOD LUCK 😄
